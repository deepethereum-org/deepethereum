# The Promise of Blockchain (Transcript)

The shift from buying physical CDs to using digital files and streaming services was driven by peer-to-peer software like Napster. This software allowed users to share music directly with each other, cutting out the traditional middlemenâ€”the music studios and retailers. This process of removing the intermediary is called disintermediation.

The idea of disintermediation can apply to many other industries. The financial industry is a prime example. Most money today is just data in a bank's centralized database. The bank acts as the middleman, processing transactions and charging fees. For instance, sending money internationally is often slow and expensive because it has to go through multiple banks, each adding their own fee and processing time.

A peer-to-peer financial system would allow direct money transfers. This would be faster and cheaper because it would cut out the banks.

However, a system without a central authority presents a big problem: trust. In a bank-run system, the bank ensures that transactions are valid and records are correct. Without this central authority, how can a system be secure and prevent fraud?

This is where blockchain comes in. Blockchain is the technology that makes a distributed peer-to-peer system trustworthy. It provides the integrity and security needed to run a system without a single central authority. It's important to note that Napster was actually a centralized peer-to-peer system, meaning it still relied on a central server. The difference between centralized and distributed systems is a key point we'll cover later.

The real value of blockchain isn't the technology itself, but its ability to enable disintermediation. It allows for decentralized systems where people can interact directly, giving them more control over their assets.
