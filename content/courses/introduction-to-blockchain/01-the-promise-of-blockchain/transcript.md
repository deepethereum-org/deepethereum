# The Promise of Blockchain (Transcript)

**Author: Abyan Majid**

Before we dive into what blockchain is and how it works, I want to first to talk about why we even care. What is the promised value of blockchain and why it's such a big deal. To do that, let's take a trip back in time to the music industry.

Can you remember the last time you bought a music CD? It's probably been a long time for most people, and maybe even NEVER, if you're Gen Z or younger. This is because the music industry went through a dramatic change. We went from buying physical CDs at a store to downloading songs, sharing MP3s, and using streaming services. This change was kicked off by a piece of software called Napster in the late 1990s.

What made Napster so revolutionary was the fact that it was a peer-to-peer system. Instead of going through a music store to get music, you could share music files directly with other people on the network. Shawn Fanning, one of the co-founders, said, "You're interacting with peers, you're exchanging information with a person down the street." Music studios had, for a long time been the middlemen between artists and listeners, and they were disintermediated and replaced by direct, peer-to-peer interactions.

The simple idea of replacing the middleman with direct peer-to-peer interactions has the potential to reshape entire industries.

Now, this discussion of replacing middlemen naturally leads to the financial industry. One of the largest digital goods we have is money. Now, what you see in your bank account isn't actually physical cash; It's just numbers in the centralized databases of financial institutions. The bank is the middleman. They process transactions, transfer funds, and charge you fees. Something as simple as sending money to someone in another country, such as remittance from parents to their child who is studying abroads, can be extraordinarily slow and expensive because it involves multiple middlemen, each with their own processes and fees.

Imagine if you could transfer money directly to another person, without a bank in the middle. The transaction would be faster and cheaper (as it should!), because it would be exactly what it is: a transfer of number between two people, literally subtract then add.

This is where blockchain comes in.

Let me pose a problem to you: If you take out the bank, the middleman, how do you trust the system? It was the case when we had the bank, or essentially a central authority, any interaction is contained and is auditable by that central authority. So, if there no such central authority, how do you stop someone from just changing the numbers in the system?

This is the exact problem that blockchain solves. Blockchain makes distributed peer-to-peer systems trustworthy. It provides the integrity and security needed to run a system without a central authority. By the way, the wording "distributed peer-to-peer" is very important distinction. Napster was actually a "centralised peer-to-peer" system. We will talk about the differences between the two in a later video.

In any case, truth be told: What excites people about blockchain isn't actually blockchain itself as a technology, but rather disintermediation. We're excited about the possibility of a new world of no middlemen. We're excited about the idea of totally decentralised systems where we can interact directly with each other have much more control over our assets.

That is the promise of blockchain.
